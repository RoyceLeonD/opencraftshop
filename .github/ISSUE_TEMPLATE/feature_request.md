**What's driving you nuts?**
Tell me what problem you're trying to solve. I bet I've been there too. Ex: "I keep buying too much wood because I can't math"

**Your brilliant idea**
What would make your life easier? Dream big - I once thought I could build a dining table in a weekend ðŸ˜‚

**What else have you tried?**
What workarounds are you using now? Duct tape? Excel spreadsheets? Crying?

**What furniture is this for?**
- [ ] Workbench (the OG disaster)
- [ ] Storage Bench (hide your shame)
- [ ] Bed Frame (sleep on your mistakes)
- [ ] Bookshelf (for all those unread woodworking books)
- [ ] New furniture type (what fresh hell is this?)
- [ ] General feature (make everything less terrible)

**Show me how it would work**
```bash
# Your dream command:
opencraftshop --make-me-look-competent
```

**Anything else?**
- Sketch on a napkin? 
- Photo of what you're trying to build?
- Link to that YouTube video that made it look easy?
- Your therapist's opinion on this project?

Remember: There are no bad ideas, only expensive mistakes waiting to happen! ðŸ”¨
