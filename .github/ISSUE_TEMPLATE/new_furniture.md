**What are we building?**
What do you call this thing? (Besides "mistake waiting to happen")

**Why does humanity need this?**
Convince me why I should risk my fingers for this project.

**How big is this disaster going to be?**
- Length: [e.g., "about yay long" or actual inches]
- Width: [e.g., "wide enough to hold my regrets"]  
- Height: [e.g., "tall enough to hide behind when it fails"]

**What parts will I mess up?**
- [ ] Legs/supports (wobbly is a feature, right?)
- [ ] Top/surface (flat-ish)
- [ ] Shelves (may or may not hold books)
- [ ] Back/sides (structural... hopefully)
- [ ] Other nightmares: 

**What expensive wood will I ruin?**
- [ ] 2x4s (old reliable)
- [ ] 2x6s (fancy!)
- [ ] 1x boards (for when you need it thin)
- [ ] Plywood (the duct tape of wood)
- [ ] Something exotic I can't afford:

**How will I screw this up... I mean, together?**
Will this need:
- Fancy joints I'll definitely mess up?
- Special tools I don't own?
- Skills I don't have?
- A prayer to the woodworking gods?

**Show me what you're thinking**
- Napkin sketches welcome
- "I saw this on Pinterest" links
- That one YouTube video that made it look easy
- Your kid's crayon drawing (probably more accurate than my cuts)

**Can you help with the code?**
- [ ] I can write OpenSCAD (you brave soul)
- [ ] I need help (join the club)
- [ ] I started something but... well, you'll see
- [ ] I'll test it by building it (RIP your wood budget)

**Anything else I should know?**
- How many times have you tried to build this already?
- What's your Home Depot return record?
- Should I increase my bandaid budget?

Remember: Every piece of furniture started as a tree that was doing just fine until we came along üå≥‚û°Ô∏èü™ëüòÖ
