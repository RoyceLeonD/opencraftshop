**What went wrong this time?**
Tell me what broke. I probably broke it the same way last week.

**How'd you break it?**
Steps to reproduce (so I can break it too):
1. I tried to '...'
2. With these settings '...'
3. Then boom ðŸ’¥

**What did you expect?**
What were you hoping would happen? (Besides "it would just work")

**The ugly error**
```
Paste the error message here
(Don't worry, I've seen worse)
```

**Your setup:**
 - OS: [e.g. Ubuntu, macOS, Windows - they all have their quirks]
 - Python version: [e.g. 3.11]
 - Docker version: [if you know]
 - OpenSCAD version: [the free one, right?]

**Anything else?**
- How much wood did this bug cost you? 
- On a scale of 1-10, how frustrated are you?
- Any creative workarounds you tried?

**Show me the damage**
If you've got:
- Broken .scad files
- Weird cut lists that would make a carpenter cry
- Screenshots of the disaster
- Photos of actual failed cuts (bonus points for creativity)
