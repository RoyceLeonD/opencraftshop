## Did you test it?
- [ ] `make test-unit` passed (or at least didn't cry)
- [ ] `make test-integration` worked (miracles happen)
- [ ] I tried weird dimensions (because users are creative)
- [ ] I added tests (you're better than me already)
- [ ] I actually built the furniture (pics or it didn't happen)

## Show me what it does
```bash
# The command that hopefully works:
make bookshelf

# What came out:

```

## The honesty checklist
- [ ] My code is no worse than what was there
- [ ] I ran the formatter (or I like to live dangerously)
- [ ] The linter only complained a little
- [ ] I added type hints (fancy!)
- [ ] I updated the docs (or added more confusion)
- [ ] My commit messages make sense (after coffee)
- [ ] I tested the edge cases (0 inch furniture, 1000 foot beds, etc.)
