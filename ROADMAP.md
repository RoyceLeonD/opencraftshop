# Roadmap - Where We're Going (Help Wanted!)

Look, the real value here isn't the cutting - it's turning "I want a shelf" into an actual plan with a shopping list. The BOM generation and design parameterization is where the magic happens. Everything else is just math.

## Current State (v0.1.0) - May 2025
- 4 furniture templates (they work!)
- BOM generator that actually tells you what to buy
- Cut optimizer (because wood is expensive)
- Parametric designs (change dimensions, get new plans)

## Summer 2025 (v0.2.0) - What I'm Working On
- [ ] **Better BOM generation** - More accurate material estimates
- [ ] **Template-agnostic design** - Drop in ANY OpenSCAD file
- [ ] **"I have this wood already" mode** - Work with what you've got
- [ ] **Metric support** - For the 95% of the world that's sane
- [ ] **Project memory** - Save designs, iterate, learn from mistakes

**Please help with this stuff. I'm drowning.**

## Fall 2025 (v0.3.0) - The AI Dreams
- [ ] **Natural language to BOM** - "I need a desk for my closet"
- [ ] **Photo to furniture** - "Build me this" *shows Pinterest*
- [ ] **Smart material suggestions** - "Use plywood here, it's cheaper"
- [ ] **Failure prediction** - "This will definitely fall apart because..."
- [ ] **OpenSCAD generation** - AI writes the design files

**If you know AI/ML, PLEASE help. I watched one YouTube video and I'm lost.**

## 2026 - The Holy Grail
- [ ] Parse hand-drawn sketches into cut lists
- [ ] "Fix my design" button that actually works
- [ ] Integration with local lumber yard inventory
- [ ] Cost optimization across different materials
- [ ] Structural analysis (will it hold books or collapse?)

## What We Really Need Help With

### Easy Stuff (Perfect for First PRs!)
- Fix my terrible spelling in docs
- Add your favorite furniture design
- Test on Windows (does it even work?)
- Add comments to the code (I forgot what half of it does)

### Medium Stuff (You Probably Know More Than Me)
- OpenSCAD parser to extract dimensions automatically
- Better optimization algorithm (FFD is so 1970s)
- Web interface (I tried, I failed, help)
- Database for saving projects

### Hard Stuff (You're Definitely Smarter Than Me)
- ML model for material usage prediction
- Computer vision for sketch â†’ design
- Structural analysis integration
- Real-time collaboration (Google Docs for furniture?)

## Why This Matters

Every time someone:
- Doesn't waste wood = ðŸŒ³ happy tree
- Builds something that doesn't wobble = ðŸ˜Š happy human  
- Saves money on lumber = ðŸ’° happy wallet
- Makes furniture from a parametric design = ðŸ¤– happy future

## The Philosophy

Keep it simple. Make it work. The bar is low (limbo low). If your code runs and doesn't delete anyone's files, it's better than what we have.

Remember: Behind every feature request is someone who just wants to build something without measuring five times and still cutting wrong.

**Seriously, please help. Open an issue. Submit a PR. Fix my bugs. Add features. Make it better. I'm just one person who can't measure straight.**
