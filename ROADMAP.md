# Roadmap

## Current State (v0.1.0)
- 4 hardcoded furniture templates
- Basic cut optimization 
- Works with Docker

## Next: Make it Not Suck (v0.2.0)
- [ ] **Template-agnostic design** - Upload any OpenSCAD file, get cuts
- [ ] **AI-powered dimension extraction** - Let AI figure out what needs cutting
- [ ] **Metric support** - Because America is weird
- [ ] **Save/load designs** - For iterating on failures

## The AI Stuff (v0.3.0)
- [ ] **Natural language to furniture** - "I need a shelf 5 feet tall"
- [ ] **Design validation** - AI tells you why it won't work before you cut
- [ ] **Material optimization AI** - Smarter than FFD algorithm
- [ ] **Mistake prediction** - "This will wobble because..."

## Maybe Eventually
- [ ] Remove furniture types completely - just parse any OpenSCAD
- [ ] AI-generated OpenSCAD from sketches/photos
- [ ] Integration with GPT-4 vision for "build this" from images
- [ ] Learn from cut failures to improve predictions

## Not Happening
- Social features
- VR/AR nonsense  
- "Community templates"
- Anything that requires me to maintain a server

## Contributing
Open a PR if you want. Or fork it. I don't care.

The goal: Make it work with ANY design, not just my 4 templates.
