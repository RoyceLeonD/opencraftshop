# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenCraftShop will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

Working on:
- Template-agnostic design (drop in any OpenSCAD file)
- Better BOM generation algorithms
- AI integration for natural language input

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-29

Initial release. Built this because I can't measure.

### Added
- **Bill of Materials generation** - The actual useful part
- **Parametric furniture designs** - Change dimensions, get new plans
- **Cut optimization** - FFD algorithm to minimize waste  
- **Cost estimation** - Know what you're getting into
- **4 furniture templates**:
  - Workbench (for making more mistakes)
  - Storage bench (for hiding mistakes)
  - Bed frame (for sleeping off mistakes)
  - Bookshelf (for books about woodworking you don't read)
- **Terminal visualization** - ASCII art of your future disasters
- **Docker environment** - Consistent failure across platforms
- **OpenSCAD integration** - 3D models that look better than reality
- **Test suite** - Tests exist (whether they test the right things...)
- **Git hooks** - Validate code before committing mistakes

### Known Issues
- Only works in imperial units (sorry, rest of the world)
- Templates are hardcoded (working on it)
- Math might be slightly wrong (measure twice!)
- Windows support is theoretical

### The Origin Story
Started this after wasting $300 on wood for a bookshelf that immediately fell over. Wife suggested I "use my computer skills." Here we are.
